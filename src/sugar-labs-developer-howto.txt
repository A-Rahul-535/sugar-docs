New to Sugar Labs?

Unlock these achievements.  Work from top to bottom.

1.  Use Sugar, Sugarizer, or Music Blocks,

    https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/how-can-i-help.md

    * by using Sugar, Sugarizer or Music Blocks you will learn how it
      works, and what can be improved.

    * mandatory; we are an open source software project, and these
      three software products are what we produce.

2.  Read our Code of Conduct,

    https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

    * especially choose an appropriate forum, and remind others to do
      the same; we use many forums, but only GitHub and the developer
      mailing list have all our members,

    * some members practice transparency and load sharing; please ask
      your questions in public so we can all learn from them,

    * mandatory; we behave best when we know what to expect.

3.  Join the developer mailing list,

    https://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel

How to ask for directions?

“How to get started as a Sugar Labs developer” above assumes you are
self-directed.  You will decide for yourself what is best for you to
do.  You will use Sugar, Sugarizer or Music Blocks, and choose what to
maintain or improve, based on;

    * your time,
    * your interest,
    * your equipment,
    * how many other people are also interested, and;
    * your previous experience with the languages and tools.

You are always the best judge of these things.  If you fail in one of
these areas, you can self-improve.

Lionel (@llaske) can tell you what needs doing in Sugarizer.  Walter
(@walterbender) can tell you what needs doing in Music Blocks.  For
Sugar, what needs doing is;

    * maintenance of activities, through to release and publishing;
      roughly 90% of our activities are not maintained,

    * maintenance of the JavaScript library and back-porting Sugarizer
      activities to Sugar; roughly 95% of the activities have not been
      back-ported,

    * maintenance of the GTK 3 toolkit and shell (for experts),

    * porting old activities to GTK 3, TelepathyGLib and Python 3;
      roughly 75% of the activities need some form of porting,

    * in conjunction with other communities, package Sugar and
      activities for Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, and any other
      distributions of interest; roughly 90% of the activities have
      not been packaged,

It is tempting to do something small like the web site.  Please don't.

New developers should avoid changes to our infrastructure, such as web
sites and documentation, until they have demonstrated their
contribution to and awareness of the source code of Sugar, Sugarizer
or Music Blocks.

This is also a cultural difference.  Sugar Labs is closer to the
innovation culture of Silicon Valley than to a university.  We don't
direct ourselves much at all.

For personal development in the open source innovation culture, please
also read How To Become A Hacker by Eric S. Raymond.
