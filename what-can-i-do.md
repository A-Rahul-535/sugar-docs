What Can I Do Now?
==================

So, now that you've setup the development environment you will
probably want to do something. Well there are many things you can
do, but here are some we've put together:

* [Write a new sugar activity][1]
* [Check out bugs and feature requests on the bug tracker][2]
* And anything else!

I'm Stuck!
==========

Well, don't worry; there are real people here who will try to help you. Some
ways to get in touch with real people are:

* [Hang out on the irc](irc://irc.freenode.net#sugar). Please stay for a
little while, as people will come and go at different times of the day.
* [Send an email on the mailing list][3]

Some of our developers have elected to be put on the list of mentors.
You can find the list [here][4].
